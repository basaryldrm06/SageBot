## Description

SageBot, an experimental project crafted for the purpose of exploring the capabilities of artificial intelligence in cryptocurrency trading decisions. This innovative initiative is not a commercial product but rather an exploration into the realms of AI-supported decision-making for trading. 
SageBot serves as a tool for users interested in experimenting with automated strategies for entering "LONG" or "SHORT" positions in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in assets like Bitcoin. 
Designed with a non-commercial ethos, SageBot aims to provide a platform for enthusiasts and learners to engage with AI-powered trading concepts, fostering a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics within the crypto landscape.

## Technologies Used

1. **Python:** The primary programming language driving SageBot's functionality and logic.

2. **TensorFlow Library:** Leveraging the power of TensorFlow for machine learning applications, enhancing SageBot's ability to analyze market trends and make informed decisions.

3. **Binance API:** SageBot connects seamlessly to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange through its API, allowing real-time access to market data and execution of trades.

4. **TA-Lib Library:** Technical Analysis Library provides essential functions for technical analysis of financial markets, aiding SageBot in evaluating market indicators.

5. **ChatGPT:** ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, is employed for code assistance, aiding developers in coding tasks and providing guidance on library usage. Additionally, ChatGPT is utilized for crafting informative log messages, enhancing communication and facilitating a smoother understanding of SageBot's operations.

## Installation

To install Project, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Install Python:**  
	- Visit [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download python. 
	- I strongly recommend downloading a version lower than 3.10 and higher than 3 to ensure that you can download it without any issues and run the Talib library smoothly.
2. **Cloning the Project into your local:**
    Go to the directory where you want to download the project using 'cd', and then type the following command
    ```bash
    $git clone https://github.com/basaryldrm06/SageBot
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
    Enter these commands in sequence.
    ```bash
    $cd SageBot
    $pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Upon successfully completing these steps, proceed to configure your settings and run the program.

In case you encounter any issues, kindly attempt to resolve them before moving forward.

If you are facing difficulties downloading the Talib library, consider trying a manual download from this [link](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).

# Configuration
Rename the file config2.py to config.py.

Open the config.py file to edit the settings, and fill in the empty fields according to your preferences.

If you do not have an api key you can obtain one from this [link](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management)

You can use the default values for other sections or customize them based on your preferences.

Once you have finished editing your settings, you will be ready to run the program.

## Running the Bot
If you have completed the previous steps, SageBot is now ready to run. Start it by entering the following command:

 ```bash
$python main.py
```

After running the command, you should see a screen similar to the one below.
